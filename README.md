# LogSwift - Intrusion Detecting System  

LogSwift is a C++-based Intrusion Detecting System designed to process, analyze, and categorize logs from a CSV file. It uses efficient data structures such as queues, binary search trees (BST), and sorting algorithms to prioritize logs by severity, enabling quick detection and response to critical threats.

## Features  

- **Log Queueing**: Logs are ingested and processed using a dynamic queue structure.  
- **BST Categorization**: Logs are stored and categorized using a Binary Search Tree for efficient management.  
- **Severity Sorting**: Implements Merge Sort to display logs in descending order of severity.  
- **CSV Input Support**: Reads logs directly from a CSV file for seamless integration.  
- **Optimized Memory Usage**: Dynamically allocates memory for managing log data.
